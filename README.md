# ORION: Operational Risk Intelligence and Observation Network

**ORION** is an AI-driven security framework designed to enhance operational risk intelligence and observation capabilities. Leveraging large language model, ORION provides robust threat detection, assessment, and response mechanisms to safeguard organizational assets and infrastructure.

## Planned Features

- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Monitor and identify potential security threats in real-time using advanced AI algorithms.
- **Comprehensive Risk Assessment**: Evaluate and prioritize risks to ensure a proactive security posture.
- **Automated Response System**: Implement automated responses to neutralize threats swiftly and efficiently.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale with your organizationâ€™s needs, ensuring consistent performance and reliability.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Intuitive interface for monitoring, managing, and reporting security incidents.

## Roadmap

- :heavy_check_mark:**Prerequisite**: Understanding Generative AI Foundations, Deploying opensource models locally.
- :heavy_check_mark:**Core Concepts**: Langchain vs LlamaIndex, AI Agents, Retrieval-augmented generation and Function Calling.
- :ballot_box_with_check:**Model Selection**: Work-in-progress
- :ballot_box_with_check:**Architecture**: Partially completed. Additional information required.

## Challenges

- **Context awareness**: Large language models don't understand concepts like us. Imagine having an English professor as a Security Manager, they can talk about organizational security and provide information to secure information systems but don't completely understand why that solution works. That English professor is our LLM and Yann LeCun and others have already addressed this issue. When protecting something it is not about what or how, it is why.
- **Compute limitation**: My current rig can run basic to intermediate models from the Ollama library but Advanced model higher compute to test the full capacity of ORION. Luckily that's a future problem.
